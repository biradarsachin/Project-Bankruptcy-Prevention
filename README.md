Objective:
• This is a classification project, since the variable to predict is binary (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy).
The goal here is to model the probability that a business goes bankrupt from different features.
• The data file contains 7 features about 250 companies

Project Architecture:
Data Collection – Data Cleaning/ EDA – Data Visualization – Model Building – Model
Evaluation – Model Deployment – Result.

Challenges Faced:
• As the data set contains only 3 unique values and half of the values are identified as duplicated values
and more the size of the data is small with 250 entries which results in inaccurate reporting, data
integrity problem.
• The biggest challenge is identifying the result in business point of view and making a decision on
selecting the best model for deployment part.
